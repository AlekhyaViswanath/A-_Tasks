## Your First Step To AI Adventures

### Task1:
    Getting familiar with Git and GitHub, be familiar with the basic git commands.
    Also maintain a git repo for all the tasks that you complete.

### Task2:
    Getting in touch with python.
    we shall start with a few pattern printing problems for now, just to get a feel for python.

  1st: For the user input n = 5 print the pattern.

    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    #####
    
  2nd:For the user input n = 4 print the pattern.

       #
      # #
     # # #
    # # # #

  3rd: For the user input n = 4 print the pattern.

       1
      121
     12321
    1234321
  
  4th: For the user input n = 5 print the pattern.

    1 2 3 4 5 
     2 3 4 5 
      3 4 5 
       4 5 
        5 
       4 5 
      3 4 5 
     2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 5 
  
  5th: For the user input n = 5 print the pattern.


    1 2 3 4 5 
    2 3 4 5 
    3 4 5 
    4 5 
    5 
    4 5 
    3 4 5 
    2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 5 

The aim of this printing exercise is to get your  mindset into a logical and problem sloving mode.

For Python help you can refer to - [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

### Task3:
    
    Refer to the below given documents and get familiar with the concepts.

- [Reading and Writing Files](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter8/)
- [Web Scrapping](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/)
- [Working with Excel Spreadsheets](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter12/)
- [Working with CSV Files and JSON Data](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter14/)
- [ Installing Third-Party Modules](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/appendixa/)

After completing Task3 small implimentation tasks will be given based on the above topics which will be updated in this page soon.

  #### Sub Tasks:

  1)Using pip(ie package manager for Python) install the following package.
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - matplotlib 
  - scikit-learn
  - requests
  - bs4
  - pillow

  2)Write a python program to take an input from the user and automatically open a browser with all the top 10 search results for the given input in new tabs ie for eg: If I type in Virat Kohli the program should open the 1st 10 search results in new tabs.Also store the URL's for the top 10 reults in a .txt file using the same program.
  challenge: 1st store the URLs in an a .txt file and from that file open the search results in new tabs.

  3)In this repo there is a folder called python_Tasks in this the solutions for the pattern problems are given but the answer for the 4th pattern is missing open an issue telling that the code is missing and then write the answer for that and send a pull request so that I can update this repo. To complete this task u will need a good understanding of how git and github works and how to collaborate using github.


### Next task will be given if and only if all the above tasks are completed.
# Wish you all the best and Lets do this together.
